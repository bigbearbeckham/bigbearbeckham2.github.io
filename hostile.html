<p><font color="red">If you dont get away fast he will catch you his speed is insane and if in a seamoth your chance are worst. Your bigger than normal he will most likely see you and grab you with his face claws and pretty much destory you very quickly so watch out he will be your main threat for a very long time but keep in mind you can scan him if you dare. He does have a brother called the ghost leviathan!</font></p>
