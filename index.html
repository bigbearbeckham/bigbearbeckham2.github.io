like the common stalker most likely the first hostile thing you will meet.</font>

<p><font color="red">Subnautica is about a ship called the aurora that gets shot down by a mysterious power. Well later in the game you see a island not just an island, but the only one in the game and it has a gaint gun on. Fear not though it only shoots a few hundred feet in the air. Thats proof that it can not shoot the massive space ship.</font>
